How to use:

First of all, thank you for trying out this app and I hope you make the most of it!
Because I didn't want to reduce the visibility of the map, I didn't fill the screen wth buttons,
instead I implemented most of the functions with gestures that I'm going to share with you here.

You can measure an area as large as you want with this app and the procedure is very simple. There
are a few steps to follow:

1)Place a marker on the map by touching the screen (you can add up to 100 markers);
2)When you are done with deploying the markers, tap the first one you placed to close the polygon;
3)After you closed the polygon, it will show on the map as a Red area with a Cyan outline. Tap
anywhere on the polygon to get it area inside a toast message (in square meters);
4)When you are done, just long click the map outside of the polygon and it will be cleared;
5)Start all over again.

Notices:
- if you long click the last marker you placed, it will be removed and you can go on from there
(WARNING: do not remove markers from in between, better clear the map);
- by clicking the marker it will show it's current position in coordinates (Lat, Long);
- in the top right corner there is a combo box from where you can select the map type you want.

Thank you for reading this!
